# DreamLand
Connecting dreamers with organizations that can help them achieve the american dream. 

##Who dreamers are:
People who came to the United States as children and meet several guidelines may request consideration of deferred action for a period of two years, subject to renewal.

*Dreamers in New York State have access to:
-Work authorization
-A Social Security number
-Medicaid health insurance (depends on income)
-A driver license in New York State

*Dreamers in New York do not have: 
-The option to receive Financial Aid, so higher education can be very costly.

*Dreamers in general do not have access to:
-A path for a long term/permanent status, so the need for legal advice might be necessary to ensure a future in the country.

###Problem we are trying to solve:

-The need for legal advice specially immigration help to renew their status every 2 years or to have access to any other type of legal advice at no cost.
-The need of educational options that are free since they cannot apply to financial aid.

###Our web app:
Dream land is a place for Dreamers to find information on organizations near them in NYC where they can receive legal advice and educational opportunities that are not necessarily college. 
This app would also allow you to save your favorite organizations and write reviews for each individual organization. 
In the future we would like to add a way for Dreamers to connect with each other and meet to create a dreamer community.
We used the Aunt Bertha API to filter out specific organizations that are more relevant to our target audience.

####How are we different:
There is just so much information out there it can get confusing! It can be hard to find the specific information you are looking for. We basically filtered the information to give results that are helpful to dreamers right away.
You can not only search and find the specific information on organizations near you, but you can share your experience giving a more personal insight to other dreamers about the services provided in specific locations.
